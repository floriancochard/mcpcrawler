### Technical Architecture
**Headline:** Built for Production from Day One

**Architecture Diagram showing:**
- Distributed Crawler Nodes
- Intelligent Content Extraction Pipeline
- Configurable Storage Layer
- Monitoring & Observability

**Technical Features:**
- **Incremental Crawling:** Only fetch changed/new content on subsequent runs
- **Checkpointing:** Resume from point of failure without re-crawling
- **Content Intelligence:** Automatic removal of navigation, ads, cookie banners
- **Configurable Extraction:** CSS selectors, custom code, or LLM-generated rules
- **Storage Flexibility:** Your database, your format, your infrastructure

---

### Content Extraction Engine
**Headline:** LLM-Optimized Content Extraction

**The Problem:** Standard crawlers extract entire pages including irrelevant content:
- Cookie notifications and banners
- Navigation menus and footers
- Advertisements and tracking scripts
- Duplicate content across pages

**Our Solution:**
- **Smart Filtering:** Removes common page elements automatically
- **Configurable Rules:** Define extraction logic via CSS selectors or custom code
- **LLM Code Generation:** Generate extraction code using LLMs, test on sample pages, then run at scale
- **Quality Assurance:** Test runs on subsets before full crawls

---

### Integration & Configurability
**Headline:** Fits Into Your Existing Tech Stack

**Configuration Options:**
- **Simple Config:** JSON-based rules for common use cases
- **Custom Code:** Full programmatic control for complex extractions
- **LLM-Assisted:** Generate extraction logic using AI, validate, then deploy
- **Storage Backends:** MongoDB, PostgreSQL, S3, or custom databases via plugins

**Code Example:**
```yaml
crawl_config:
  targets: ["https://example.com/docs/*"]
  extraction:
    remove: [".cookie-banner", ".navigation", ".ads"]
    extract: [".main-content", ".article-body"]
  storage:
    type: "mongodb"
    connection: "mongodb://your-cluster"
  schedule: "daily"
```
